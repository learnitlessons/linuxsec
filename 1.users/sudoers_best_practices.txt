=== Sudoers Best Practices Summary ===

1. ALWAYS use visudo to edit sudoers files
2. Test configurations with 'visudo -c' before applying
3. Use /etc/sudoers.d/ for modular configurations
4. Implement principle of least privilege
5. Use command aliases for better maintainability
6. Enable logging for audit compliance

=== Production Recommendations ===

- Document all custom sudo policies
